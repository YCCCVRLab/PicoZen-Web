## üåê Network Requirements

### Same Network
- **Computer and headset must be on the same WiFi network**
- Some corporate/school networks block device-to-device communication
- Guest networks often have isolation enabled

### Firewall Settings
- Windows: Allow PicoZen through Windows Firewall
- Mac: System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Firewall > Options
- Router: Ensure AP Isolation is disabled

### Alternative: Hotspot Mode
If network issues persist:
1. Enable hotspot on your headset
2. Connect computer to headset's hotspot
3. Use the hotspot gateway IP (usually `192.168.43.1:8080`)

## üîç Troubleshooting

### "Connection Failed" Error

**Check Network Connection:**
```bash
# Test if headset is reachable
ping 192.168.1.100

# Test if web server is running
curl http://192.168.1.100:8080
```

**Common Solutions:**
1. **Restart PicoZen app** on headset
2. **Disable/re-enable web server** in app
3. **Check firewall settings** on both devices
4. **Try different port** (some routers block certain ports)
5. **Use headset hotspot** instead of WiFi

### "No Files Found" Error

**Possible Causes:**
- Directory is actually empty
- App doesn't have storage permissions
- Files are in a different location

**Solutions:**
1. Grant storage permissions to PicoZen
2. Navigate to `/sdcard/` or `/storage/emulated/0/`
3. Upload test files using PicoZen app first

### Slow Connection

**Optimization Tips:**
- Use 5GHz WiFi instead of 2.4GHz
- Reduce distance between devices
- Close other network-heavy apps
- Use wired connection for computer if possible

### Downloads Not Working

**Browser Issues:**
- Try different browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Disable popup blockers
- Check download permissions
- Clear browser cache

**Network Issues:**
- Large files may timeout
- Try downloading smaller files first
- Check available storage space

## üõ†Ô∏è Advanced Configuration

### Custom Server URLs
For advanced users running custom servers:
```javascript
// In browser console, set custom server
localStorage.setItem("filesServerUrl", "http://your-server:port");
```

### API Endpoints
The web interface expects these endpoints:
- `GET /?action=list` - Returns JSON file listing
- `GET /path/to/file?action=download` - Downloads file
- CORS headers must be enabled

### Security Considerations
- **Local Network Only:** Never expose to internet
- **Temporary Use:** Disable web server when not needed
- **File Permissions:** Be cautious with sensitive files
